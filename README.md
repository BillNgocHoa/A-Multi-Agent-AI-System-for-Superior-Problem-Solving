# A-Multi-Agent-AI-System-for-Superior-Problem-Solving
This project explores how multiple AI agents—each with a unique role like idea generator, critic, pragmatist, and refiner—can collaborate using GPT to solve open-ended problems more effectively than a single agent. The system simulates expert teamwork, producing more creative, practical, and well-rounded solutions through structured dialogue.
