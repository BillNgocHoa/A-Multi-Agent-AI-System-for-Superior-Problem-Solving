# A-Multi-Agent-AI-System-for-Superior-Problem-Solving
This project explores how multiple AI agents—each with a unique role like idea generator, critic, pragmatist, and refiner—can collaborate using GPT to solve open-ended problems more effectively than a single agent. The system simulates expert teamwork, producing more creative, practical, and well-rounded solutions through structured dialogue.

# Cognitive Synergy: Multi-Agent Collaboration with LLMs for Superior Problem Solving

This project explores a novel approach to problem-solving using a **multi-agent AI system** powered by GPT-4o. Inspired by human teamwork and cognitive diversity theory, four uniquely designed AI agents—**Idea Generator, Critic, Pragmatist, and Refiner**—collaborate within a structured conversation to solve open-ended, real-world problems more effectively than a single AI agent.

> 💡 Result: The system consistently delivers **more thoughtful, practical, and well-rounded solutions** than standalone agents, especially in complex or ambiguous scenarios.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent System**: Four AI agents with distinct personalities and thinking styles work together.
- 🧠 **Cognitive Diversity**: Roles are designed based on the Six Thinking Hats and research in group intelligence.
- 🛠️ **Prompt Engineering**: Each agent is defined with role-specific, constraint-based, and behavior-anchored prompts.
- 🔁 **Custom Orchestrator**: Manages agent turn-taking via round-robin or priority-based strategies.
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Built with Flask for easy interaction, agent selection, and live multi-agent chat visualization.
- 📊 **Evaluation Framework**: Combines human feedback and LLM evaluation (Gemini) across metrics like creativity, feasibility, and logical flow.
