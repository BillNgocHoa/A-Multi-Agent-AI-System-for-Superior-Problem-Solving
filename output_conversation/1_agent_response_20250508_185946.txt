1. **Create a Dedicated Workspace**: Designate a specific area as your workspace, even if it's just a small corner or a part of a room. This separation helps psychologically signal that it's time to focus and work. Use affordable items like a foldable table and a comfortable chair to make this space functional. Keep this area tidy and organized to minimize distractions. By having a consistent spot for work, you are more likely to switch into a productive mindset each time you sit there.

2. **Utilize Time Management Techniques**: Techniques like the Pomodoro Technique can be very effective and come at zero cost. This method involves working in focused blocks of time (typically 25 minutes), followed by a 5-minute break. These short bursts of focused work can enhance concentration and manage time more effectively. You can use free timers on your smartphone or online tools to structure your work sessions and breaks accordingly.

3. **Limit Digital Distractions**: Use free or low-cost browser extensions and applications that block distracting websites and notifications during work hours. For instance, apps like StayFocusd or Freedom can help you stay away from social media and other non-work-related sites. Additionally, consider setting your phone to "Do Not Disturb" mode during focused work sessions to minimize interruptions from calls or notifications. This approach helps in maintaining a clear mental state aimed at completing the task at hand.
